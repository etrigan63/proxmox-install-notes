### Wordpress LXC and Site Migration
----------
Not gonna lie, migrating Wordpress is a bit of a shitshow. I ended up deploying `ghost` and migrating the site to that platform. `ghost` provides migration tools that work, Not super fast, but all of the images and content were copied over. I will have to tweak the content format a little, but the site is up and a couple of terminal commands charged the base URL.
